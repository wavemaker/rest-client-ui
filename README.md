# Rest Import UI

This Application represents an API platform for building and using APIs.

## Setting up a dev environment

Rest Import UI includes a development server that provides hot module reloading and unminified stack traces, for easier development.

### Prerequisites

- git, any version
- **Node.js >=16.13.2** and **npm >=8.1.2** are the minimum required versions that this repo runs on, but we recommend using the latest version of Node.js@16

## Development

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to <http://localhost:3000/>. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.

1. `rest-import-bundle.js`
2. `rest-import-bundle.css`
